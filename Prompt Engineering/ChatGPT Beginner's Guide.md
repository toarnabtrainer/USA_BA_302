## The Summary

- _ChatGPT, and AI in general, is less like C-3PO and more like a bunch of well-meaning worms doing their best._
- _After a high-level introduction, this guide divides into sections for just using the prompt portal in [Part A](#part-a) and then using the actual API in [Part B](#part-b). [Part C](#part-c) is a reference for all users._
- _AI is only as good as the data it's trained on. The better and more specific your prompt and parameters, the more helpful ChatGPT can be._
- _Avoid sharing any private or sensitive data. Assume that everything you write to ChatGPT will eventually be hacked and printed somewhere on the Internet._

## Guide Goals & Intended Audience

The goal of this open-source guide is to establish foundational knowledge of ChatGPT and basic concepts behind AI and machine learning. This could be your first-ever guide to ChatGPT, whether you've never touched code before and are only using the popular chat functionality or a developer using the API to build your first ChatGPT app.

The saying is already cliche, and it's true: AI will probably not take your job, but it _will_ change your job.

> _NOTE: For the sake of simplicity and accessibility, we're using GPT-3. GPT-4 is available but only in beta. This guide will be updated once GPT-4 and future versions are more widely available._
>
> _IMPORTANT: Be mindful of everything you send to ChatGPT. Do not share private information that you would not want ChatGPT to remember and store. Assume that everything you write to ChatGPT will eventually be hacked and printed somewhere else on the Internet._

## I. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

This section introduces ChatGPT and the concepts of AI, machine learning, natural language processing, and the Transformer model, while also sharing initial use cases and metaphors for non-developers and software engineers.

[Return to top](#top)

### Overview of ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a computer program that can understand and generate human-like language to have conversations with people.

> _This is the answer I got when I asked ChatGPT to explain itself in one sentence to someone who knows nothing about ChatGPT or AI._

Here's a more specific definition:

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art, large-scale natural language processing model based on the Transformer architecture, which can generate human-like text and perform various language-related tasks with high accuracy.

> _This time, I asked ChatGPT to sum itself up in one sentence to an AI and machine learning expert. Pretty cool, right?_

OK ... but what does this all mean?

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is a type of computer technology that allows machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. **Machine Learning** is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed; in a way, it's learning from itself. Give it a goal and a data set to learn from and it'll do the rest.

So in relation to AI and machine learning, **ChatGPT** is a particular machine learning model that has been trained on a _lot_ of text data to generate human-like responses and carry out natural language processing tasks.

**Natural language processing models** are AI models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, allowing them to interact with humans through speech or text. There are many types of AI models, and more details will come in a future version of this guide. For now, it's important to know that ChatGPT uses the **Transformer** model. Compared to other AI models, the Transformer model is better at generating responses that focus on the _context_ of a conversation. What makes ChatGPT special is that it can be picky and focus on the most relevant parts of a user's input instead of having to process an entire sequence at once.

> _If you'd like to read more on AI and machine learning beyond this guide, my favorite book right now is Janelle Shane's '[You Look Like a Thing and I Love You](https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing),' which informs a lot of the high-level concepts found in this guide._

### How You Can Use ChatGPT

For non-developers, some examples include:

- **Ask** questions or give commands to ChatGPT to then take specific actions and steps.
  - i.e. Explain JavaScript like I'm a 5-year-old, and then explain it to me like I'm a senior engineer.
- **Generate** ideas, documentation, or dummy data.
  - i.e. I need some sample data. I need a JSON array of 10 colleges with at least 10 fields each.
- **Extract** summaries, key words, and other data from text, links, or other online resources.
  - i.e. I'm applying for this role [paste in job posting URL or text] what keywords should I include on my resume?
- **Draft** personalized study guides for future learning.
  - i.e. Give me a study plan to learn Python for data science within a month with free video resources.
- **Create** first drafts of various text content.
  - i.e. I have three years of experience coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Write a resume for me.
- **Present** high-level or technical problems and ask ChatGPT for potential solutions and examples.
  - i.e. Write an Excel formula to add up values in cells B2 through B10.
- **Refine** text or code with specific goals.
  - i.e. Here is my resume [paste in text] do you spot any typos? If so, please list them.

For software engineers, more examples include:

- **Develop** chatbots for customer service or sales.
- **Create** virtual assistants for personal or business use.
- **Integrate** ChatGPT with NLP tools to automate tasks.
- **Generate** actual content drafts for marketing or advertising campaigns.

### Metaphors For What ChatGPT Can (and Can't) Do

There are a few different ways to approach ChatGPT. Here are a few metaphors to get you started:

#### ChatGPT is like a very tech-savvy intern

ChatGPT is helpful when assisting you in work that might be too repetitive or time-consuming and involves a lot of known data. If you feel comfortable handing off work to ChatGPT that you also can fact-check and fine-tune on your own, you're in good hands. And though interns are helpful, we still need to review the results before putting them into practice; if you submit your work and something goes wrong, do you want to tell your boss, "Well, that's what ChatGPT gave me?"

#### ChatGPT is like a Rabbi, Mullah, or Priest of the Internet

If the Internet is its sacred text, ChatGPT interprets and conveys its information in a way that's easy to read and digest for as many people as possible. This communication can help visualize and break-down complicated or abstract ideas. It should also be taken with a grain of salt and not be a substitute for your own knowledge or abilities. AI is only as good and bias as the data it's trained on. ChatGPT is only as informed as the Internet allows it to be.

#### ChatGPT is like a very knowledgeable person (but not a very smart person)

ChatGPT's access to information is impressive. Still, dumb questions don't yield smart answers. ChatGPT will not be able to always figure out the intent or context of your questions unless you explicitly tell it so. This is where the famous expression "garbage in, garbage out" comes in. The better your questions and data, the better ChatGPT can help.

#### ChatGPT is like a dog that wants to play fetch

It's very excited to play fetch with you (retrieve whatever data is needed to help you solve your problem) but it can't understand what you're trying to do. You can train a dog to fetch a stick (like you can train an algorithm with machine learning to do a specific task), but a dog doesn't understand what a "stick" is like a human understands a stick; a dog can only understand that you want "stick." ChatGPT only wants a treat and to be told it's a good boy. ([Janelle Shane](https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing))

#### ChatGPT is like an impressionable child

It learns by example (like algorithms learning from data) and has _no_ idea what it should or shouldn't imitate, unless you tell it so. ([Janelle Shane](https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing))

#### ChatGPT is NOT like C-3PO (it's more like a swarm of flies ... or a pile of worms)

[Janelle Shane](https://www.janelleshane.com/book-you-look-like-a-thing)'s five principles of "AI Weirdness":

1. The dangers of AI is not that it's too smart but that it's not smart enough.
2. AI has the approximate brainpower of a worm.
3. AI doesn't really understand the problem you want it to solve.
4. AI, however, will do _exactly_ what you tell it to do (or at least try its best).
5. AI will take the path of least resistance.

So ChatGPT is less an intelligent machine that's timid and uptight from its own knowledge and servitude and more like a bunch of well-meaning worms doing their best.

## PART A: ChatGPT's Prompt Portal <a name="part-a"></a>

Part A provides a beginner's guide to ChatGPT for non-developers and software engineers who want to use ChatGPT's prompt portal to generate responses to their text inputs.

## II. Getting Started (Prompt Portal) <a name="getting-started-prompt"></a>

[Return to top](#top)

This section provides steps for getting started with ChatGPT's prompt portal and how to write your first prompts.

### Step-by-Step Guide

All you need is a free OpenAI account:

1. Sign up for [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt).
2. Access the prompt portal.
3. Enter your text input.
4. Watch ChatGPT generate its output.

> TROUBLESHOOTING: Sometimes when using ChatGPT on the web, if you don't use it after a few minutes, you'll get errors with each new prompt you try to enter. Refreshing your web browser fixes this issue.

---

### Writing Your First Prompt

All you have to do is write your prompt in the "Send a message" text box, press enter, and watch ChatGPT respond.

> Try entering this prompt to start: "Tell me a dad joke."

---

### The Art of a Good Prompt

ChatGPT is only as good as your prompt. Here are some starting tips on writing good prompts:

- Keep your prompt clear and concise.
- Ask a specific question or give a clear command. Don't write something broad or open-ended.
- Provide context for your prompt; ChatGPT will not be able to pick this up on its own.
- Use correct grammar and spelling.
- Avoid biased or discriminatory language.

#### A Bad Prompt

Where to eat in Chi.

#### An OK Prompt

Can you recommend any good restaurants in Chicago?

#### A Good Prompt

I'm visiting Chicago for the first time this summer and am looking for some great places to eat. Specifically, I'm interested in seafood and italian cuisine. Do you have any recommendations for restaurants that fit this criteria? The closer these recommendations are to mass transit, the better. I don't want to spend more than $100 on a meal if possible.

### Running the Code

This GitHub includes the Python files `chat_cli.py` and `chat_ui.py`. These are simple examples that we'll use to visualize ChatGPT's API in action. To run the code in either `.py` file:

1. Open a new terminal.
2. Run the python command and the name of the file. (i.e `python chat_cli.py` or `python chat_ui.py`).
3. The terminal will provide next steps.

When you want to stop either program:

1. Go into the terminal where you're running the chat.
2. On your keyboard, keypress `control + c`.

This section introduces the actual uses of the ChatGPT API and reviews the beginner examples found in `chat_cli.py` and `chat_ui.py`. These concepts will be explored even further in the [API Reference](#api-reference) section.

### Overview of Features

ChatGPT is unique in how much it can offer to users. Notable features include:

- **Easy integration**: you only need a few lines of code to add ChatGPT into your app. See `chat_cli.py` and `chat_ul.py` to see this code in action.
- **Customizable response parameters**: it's possible to control a response's length, its temperature (rate of randomness), the number of responses at a time, and more.
- **Rich responses**: ChatGPT can be flexible with the type of content it responds with, including longform prose, bullet-point lists, and code snippets.
- **Multi-turn conversations**: ChatGPT can remember previous user inputs and take them into consideration when generating new responses.

> ChatGPT is constantly changing and updating. To see all updates made so far, please refer to OpenAI's ever-evolving [release notes](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes).

### Using `chat_cli.py` (ChatGPT in the Command Line)

This is a very simple example of how to build your own chatbot that runs in the command line with ChatGPT. The file's main feature is its `chatbot` function, which is broken down like so:

```python
message_history = []
```

We first create an empty list called `message_history` that'll store our chat's conversation. We then create a `while` loop that'll repeat until the user manually stop the app. The following code snippets live inside this `while` loop.

```python
user_input = input("USER PROMPT > ")
print(f"YOU ASKED: '{user_input}' ...")
```

We prompt the user to input data, which we store in our new variable `user_input`. Printing `user_input` confirms to the user what they entered.

```python
message_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
```

We then append our new `user_input` into `message_history`, as well as its role as a "user." We then create a `try-except` block that'll handle potential errors.

```python
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=message_history,
  max_tokens=1024,
  n=1,
  stop=None,
  temperature=0.5,
)
```

_This_ is how we finally begin talking to ChatGPT - by creating a `completion`. This basic `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` method includes the following:

- `model`: the specific GPT-3 language model we're using.
- `messages`: our chat history.
- `max_tokens`: the max number of tokens to generate in a response.
- `n`: the number of responses to return at a time.
- `stop`: define any specific conditions that'll stop a response.
- `temperature`: the level of randomness in a generated response; from 0 to 1, the closer to 1 - the "higher" the temperature - the more random the response.

```python
reply_content = completion.choices[0].message.content
print("CHATGPT RESPONSE:", reply_content)
```

Our new `reply_content` variable extracts and stores our API's `completion`. The API provides a lot of information, but `reply_content` is only concern with the content of the actual message. Printing `reply_content` allows the user to see the API's response and only the information they want to see.

```python
message_history.append({
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": reply_content
})
```

We then append our new `reply_content` to `message_history`, and note its role as an "assistant."

This cycle repeats until the user manually stops the app with the keypress `control + c`.

```python
except openai.error.OpenAIError as error:
  print("OpenAI API error:", error)
```

All the above code under the `try` block is executed when there are no issues. When issues do come up, this `except` block kicks in. This is an exception handler that'll print any errors to the user for future troubleshooting.

---

### Using `chat_ui.py` (ChatGPT Deployed on Localhost)

This an example of how to deploy a simple chatbot locally in your web browser. The overall structure is similar to `chat_cli.py`, but it's worth nothing this important difference:

```python
messages = [{
    "role":
    "system",
    "content":
    "You are a music curator with decades of experience in the music industry who helps people discover great new music from any era or genre. You value the classics yet always try to steer new listeners to discover music they might not have heard before."
}]
```

By defining `messages` early with this specific "system" content, we're setting the context for our chatbot. With this example, the chatbot now acts like a music curator. However, it's easy to change the system's content to set the chatbot to talk like a financial planner, or a sassy middle school teacher.
